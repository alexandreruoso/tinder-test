# Tinder-Like Swiping Prototype (React Test Assignment)

This project is a fully-tested, production-ready prototype of a Tinder-like swiping application. It is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Material-UI.

It features a complete local development environment using Mock Service Worker (MSW), comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage via Vitest, and end-to-end tests with Playwright.

## Features

- Modern Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, and MUI.
- Mocked API: Uses Mock Service Worker (MSW) for a stable and predictable development experience without a live backend.
- Fully Tested:
    - 100% Unit Test Coverage with Vitest & React Testing Library.
- Component Library: All UI components are documented and viewable in Storybook.
- Production Ready: Includes a Dockerfile for building a lightweight, production-ready
- Nginx container.
- View user profiles one by one.
- "Like" or "Dislike" a profile.
- Receive a "match" notification for mutual likes.
- Gracefully handles running out of profiles.
